# Final Project: Paradise Nursery Shopping Application
### Introduction
In this final project, I created a shopping cart application for an online plant shop which offers a variety of house plants.

The Paradise Nursery shopping cart features will include:
- A Landing page with a button linking to the product listing page
- A navigation bar with links to the landing, product listing, and shopping cart pages
- A card for each plant that showcases the different plants along with their images, name, description, cost and an Add to cart button.
- A minimum of two sections describing the plants in that section. For example, "Aromatic Plants" and "Medicinal Plants".
- A cart page which displays the products in the cart.
- The cart should have a card for each type of plant in the cart. Each card should have the thumbnail, the unit cost, the cost for all of the plants of that type and buttons to increase and decrease the quantity along with Delete button.
- A Continue Shopping and Checkout buttons

I implementd the knowledge and skills I gained from working on the practice project to handle dynamic functionalities, like the show cart quantity in the icon on the navbar and updating the cost of all of the items in the cart when the user updates the number of items.

### Project Submission
To submit my application for grading, I needd to deploy it. I needed to provide the URL as part of the peer review project. I used GitHub Pages to host. I found the instructions from the Setting Up the GitHub Environment lab earlier in this module.

### Learning objectives
After completing this lab, I was able to:

React Components: Create functional React components using component composition and nesting.
State Management with Hooks: Implement React Hooks, specifically the useState and useEffect hooks. I managed component-level state using hooks to control the visibility of elements.
Redux Integration: Integrate Redux within an application using Redux concepts like actions, reducers, and the store.
Rendering Dynamic Data: Dynamically render data fetched from an array of objects into the UI. I mapped over arrays to generate lists of components.
Handling Events and Conditional Rendering: Handle user events such as button selection and trigger corresponding actions.
